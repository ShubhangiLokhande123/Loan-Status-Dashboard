# Loan-Status-Dashboard
This dashboard is build using PowerBI tool.
We can find out some inferences about good loans and bad loans such as-
1. Loans by 'A' grade employees are all in 'Good Loan' categories whereas loans by 'E' grade employees are all in 'Bad Loan' categories.
   And loans by 'B','C','D' grades are mixed in nature.
